# 4-H GitHub Workshop

## Hello there!
Welcome to the GitHub Workshop. The goals of this workshop are to provide you a broad overview of what GitHub is and the tools you'll need for your project.
Please refer to this [Google presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N9V74i6dsiyunjtv1oVDxFt5feKuLJApictSREEobSs/edit?usp=sharing) for a more in-depth overview. 

## Brief Overview of What Git and GitHub are
### Git
- Is a version control system that tracks changes in files and coordinates work on those files with multiple people
- Useful for managing group and side projects, hackathons, etc.

### GitHub
- A code hosting platform for version control and collaboration
- Lets you work with others on projects from anywhere in the world
- Can also serve as a portfolio for your awesome projects

## Git Workflow
These are commands you must know/be comfortable with when working with Git. 

1. Edit all the files you want
2. Add your changes
    - You want git to pay attention to these specific files
    - Changes to these files will be bundled in your next commit
3. Commit the files you added
    - Each commit represents all the edits, additions, and deletions you've made since the last commit
    - Think of this as bundling all your recent changes
    - Commit messages are created to briefly describe what kinds of changes you've made
4. Push your commit
    - Takes the commits from your local repo and sends them out to your central repo (GitHub)
    - This allows collaborators to see your changes on GitHub and can download them
